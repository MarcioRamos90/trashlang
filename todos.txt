00.00.01 - (here the goal is to have a language that suports the mathematic operations like '+ - / *')
- simple lexer [ok]
- simple parser [ok] - no precedence verification
- precedence verification [ok]
- add parenteses verification [ok]
- add more test cases with nested parenteses [doing]

- add syntax errors like [todo]:
    [] (2 3) - distinct numbers have to habe operations to parse
    [] (2 ++- 5) - humm I don't know what kind error is this (in math it just would be 2 - 5, but here I need to decide)
